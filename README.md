Media Controller is mainly a personal project of mine and is currently in its early Alpha stages there is a release build for friends that wanna test it and make sure the basic functions of it works. 

Functionality 
1. Pause/Play media and skip or go to previous tracks. 
2. Volume Control currently can only control system volume working on adding app volume control as well
3. Stay ontop of all other apps even when not tabbed in. (This will be toggable in the future) But allows you to not have to tab back into your app that you were playing music in in order to pause/play it. 

How to use volume control? 

You can use volume control by clicking on show menu this is still very early stages of the build so this is subject to change in the future. 
Then just adjust the slider. 

You can click the release tab in order to download the current release build.
